I’m Usamah Moin Mohammed, a passionate software engineer and data enthusiast with a flair for blending creativity and technical expertise. With a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington and extensive hands-on experience across a variety of tech domains, I thrive in solving complex problems and driving innovation in the tech space.

Throughout my career, I’ve held diverse roles, each contributing to my growth as a multifaceted tech professional:

- As a **Web Developer Student Assistant and Researcher** at the University of Texas at Arlington, I streamlined content management for over 50 websites, significantly improving user experience and operational efficiency. Additionally, I conducted research in Scala distributed systems, exploring fault tolerance, scalability, and performance improvements for distributed applications.
- During my time as a **Backend Developer** at Infosys, I played a crucial role in developing a data visualization tool to monitor $11.5 million in monthly revenue, while optimizing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and ensuring system scalability.
- In my internship as a **Software Developer** at Winning Edge Labs, I collaborated with the development team to design and implement applications, including a chatbot-based registration form that reduced user registration time by 25%.

I specialize in backend development, data engineering, and distributed systems. My recent ventures include using Redis and Ollama for contextual semantic search, building robust data pipelines with Apache Airflow and Spark, and exploring the potential of Explainable AI. 

I believe in the power of technology to transform businesses and empower individuals. Whether it’s through building scalable software solutions or using data to drive decision-making, my goal is to stay at the forefront of tech innovation.

Feel free to explore my work, projects, and insights. I'm always open to collaborating on exciting ideas and new opportunities.
